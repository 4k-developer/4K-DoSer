+ No development at this time

The script needs cURL so yes (unless you can get curl on android without root)

## How do I know if it worked?
The website (or certain sections of it) will return some sort of error (Usually Error 500)

## Why can't I DoS anything?
+ This is is still a work in progress
+ Most likely won't work any websites
+ Try a Wordpress or Drupal powered site
